## Introduction ##

In this project, I will be developing mutation test by:
- Identifying and define specific mutation operators that you will apply to the class.
- Implement said mutation operators, by applying them to the different mutations.
- Test all mutations 
- Lastly results should be analyzed and improved upon.


## List of defined mutation operators ##
One mutation operator I used was mutmut.

## Description of applied mutations and their impact ##
The current mutations applied has multiple functions such as 

## Summary of mutant survival and killing ##
I had no success in getting the code to work, 
Possible Solution:
- Create a CI framework
After creating a CI, with python packages, which includes pytest,
I tried to run the mutation test again however it failed.


## Analysis of the test suite's effectiveness ##
So far, since there is a break in my framework, my efficeny is zero,
Until I find the bug that is causing this my problem, my efficeny will
stay at zero.

## Recommendations for improving the test suite ##
One thing that would improve the test suite......

## Conclusion ##
Currently, trying to get my mutation test to run, however once they run I will be able to provide solution.
