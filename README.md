## Introduction ##

In this project, I will be developing mutation test by:
- Identifying and define specific mutation operators that you will apply to the class.
- Implement said mutation operators, by applying them to the different mutations.
- Test all mutations 
- Lastly results should be analyzed and improved upon.


## List of defined mutation operators ##
One mutation operator I used was mutmut.
## Description of applied mutations and their impact ##



## Summary of mutant survival and killing ##

## Analysis of the test suite's effectiveness ##

## Recommendations for improving the test suite ##

## Conclusion ##
