## Introduction ##

In this project, I will be developing mutation test by:
- Identifying and define specific mutation operators that you will apply to the class.
- Implement said mutation operators, by applying them to the different mutations.
- Test all mutations 
- Lastly results should be analyzed and improved upon.


## List of defined mutation operators ##
One mutation operator I used was mutmut.

## Description of applied mutations and their impact ##
The current mutations applied has multiple functions such as 

## Summary of mutant survival and killing ##
I had no success in getting the code to work, 
Possible Solution:
- Create a CI framework

## Analysis of the test suite's effectiveness ##
-N/A

## Recommendations for improving the test suite ##
-N/A

## Conclusion ##
Currently, trying to get my mutation test to run, however once they run I will be able to provide solution.
